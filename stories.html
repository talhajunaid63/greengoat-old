			The Boston Children's Museum used to be a factory back in the day.  
			About halfway through the project, I spied some original fire shutters 
			leaning against the dumpster.  I'm often struck	by the beauty of well worn materials.  
			Like the perfect pair of jeans, a thrashed door with peeling paint tells 
			the story of passing years and ... persistence,	I guess.</p>
			<p>These shutters were rusted through, and the red paint had faded to a nice,
			weatherbeaten persimmon.  I asked the site super for a few days on them, 
			and began making calls.  After a few strike outs with local sculptors, I remembered 
			the set design warehouse for the ART across from Anderson McQuaid in Cambridge. I got the 
			name of the set design director and dialed.</P>
			<P>"Hi ... this is Amy from greenGoat.  I was wondering whether you'd like some industrial
			'castle doors' for an upcoming production.  I thought they might make good props for an updated
			version of Hamlet or something."</P>
			<P>ART sent a truck over the next day, and I could not have been prouder to see a few
			pieces of our industrial legacy live on.  So much of it has drifted away.  
			I wonder if the shutters ever made it on stage.

			greenGoat goes way beyond anything you think you know about salvage.  If given
			the time to set up pre-placement, we can make extraordinary things happen.
			The stories write themselves!</P>

			<p>We have staffing to suit the scope of any project.</p>
