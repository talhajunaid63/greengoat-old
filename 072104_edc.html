            <p><span class="header1green"><strong>Did you know the upcoming national political conventions will
            demonstrate green practices?</strong></span> </p>
            <p>    Michelle Hucal, Editor and LEED AP </p>            <p>In a remarkable collaborative effort, the Coalition for Environmentally
              Responsible Conventions (CERC), working with the organizers of
              the Democratic and Republican conventions, will deploy and showcase
              environmental best practices at the political parties' 2004 conventions.
              CERC, a non-partisan alliance of over 60 organizations and 200
              volunteers, aims to reach political leaders, private sector decision
              makers and an international audience and to establish a legacy
              of environmental best practices for large meetings, urban living
              and commerce. </p>
            <p>To start, Shawmut Design and Construction will employ green building
              practices and, wherever possible, environmentally preferred materials
              in their portion of the multi-million dollar construction project
              at Boston's Fleet Center. Shawmut will use green building practices
              they have used in the past and also new ones proposed by <strong>greenGoat,
              a resource management adviser on the CERC waste management team </strong>. </p>
            <p>Additionally, the plan includes recycling more than 3,000 sheets
              of unpainted gypsum wallboard and miles of fiber optic cable. Finally,
              the two-story press pavilion will be dismantled and used again
              after the Convention, preventing the waste of construction materials. </p>
            <p>The Democratic National Convention Committee (DNCC), partnering
              with Scanlon Associates, will also launch the Recycled Paper Poster
              Project, which will take wastepaper generated by the first day
              of the Convention and, within twenty-four hours, transform it into
              posters that are given to Convention attendees. </p>
            <p>Two events have agreed to use food grown on Massachusetts farms
              - the 15,000-person media party and the Massachusetts delegation
              party. Food waste from the media reception will be transported
              to a licensed composting facility that will convert it into a valuable
              soil fertilizer. The Greater Boston Food Bank's Second Helping
              program will &quot;rescue&quot; unused food from the Convention
              and Convention-related venues and provide it to community hunger-relief
              agencies. (This was arranged independently of CERC.) </p>
            <p>The Convention will even use confetti made from recycled paper
              and biodegradable balloons in their celebrations. </p>
            <p>General Motor's low-emission hybrid buses will shuttle delegates
              on a tour of two recently completed “green” buildings. Hybrid buses
              will also be used to transport delegates to other destinations,
              and CERC is arranging a training for drivers of diesel buses to
              limit idling of their engines, as required by a recent Massachusetts
              law. </p>
            <p>The Fleet Center's energy use during the Convention will be matched
              by renewable power through CERC's engagement with emerging market-based
              incentive systems to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. CERC has
              purchased $11,000 of renewable energy certificates (RECs) that
              represent the &quot;non-emissions&quot; value of wind power from
              Massachusetts and Colorado, hydro power from Connecticut and landfill
              gas power from California. Constellation New Energy, the company
              that purchases electricity for the Fleet Center, will donate 300
              additional RECs plus the electricity associated with those RECs.
              Some of the power for the convention will come from a 250-kilowatt
              fuel cell power plant from FuelCell Energy, Inc. that converts
              natural gas into electricity in a way that generates 99 percent
              less dangerous air pollution than combustion-based fossil fuel
              power plants. CERC is also employing &quot;greenhouse gas emission
              reduction credits&quot; (GGCs) to &quot;green&quot; the emissions
              from the fossil fuel use that will be expended to transport delegates
              to and from the Convention. </p>
            <p>CERC has also organized a &quot;New Energy for America&quot; event
              at The State Room in Boston on Wednesday, July 28, promoting polices
              for renewable energy and energy efficiency that support the creation
              of jobs in America. </p>
            <p>On May 28, the Saunders Hotel Group -- which owns several Boston-area
              hotels -- and Boston-based non-profit CERES' Green Hotel Initiative
              organized a Green Hotels Seminar on behalf of CERC to educate and
              encourage Boston-area hotels to use green practices in their operations,
              including waste management, energy and water conservation, and
              the use of environmentally preferable products for laundry, cleaning,
              lighting and grounds maintenance. A similar comprehensive program
              of practices and events is planned for the Republican Convention,
            which begins in New York City on August 30. </p>
