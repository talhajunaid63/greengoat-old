              then dismantled with environment
            in mind </strong></p>
            <p>01:00 AM EDT on Tuesday, August 3, 2004 </p>
            <p><strong>BY CYNDI ROY </strong><strong><br>

            <p>BOSTON -- More than 60 tons of the Democratic National Convention
              will live on, as construction materials used to transform the FleetCenter
              into a TV and media-friendly backdrop are dismantled and recycled
              for use by non-profits and contractors instead of being shipped
              off to a landfill. </p>
            <p>Cleanup crews have 10 days to tear down the convention setup,
              which took six weeks to construct. A concert by pop star Prince
              Aug. 17 is the first scheduled post-convention event at the downtown
              arena. </p>
            <p><b>Collaborating with environmental groups, workers from Nova construction
              are quickly tearing up the temporary walls and halls, preparing
              to donate some of the materials to six local arts and charity groups
              and the rest to companies that will either salvage the materials
              for new projects or recycle them, said Amy Bauman of GreenGoat,
              an environmental group that works to ensure environmentally-friendly
              construction projects. </p>
            <p>&quot;Conventions come together for three or four days and then
              they're gone,&quot; Bauman said. &quot;There's an enormous amount
              of waste in this industry.&quot; </p>
            <p>Bauman described the teardown process as &quot;peeling back the
              layers of an onion.&quot; In this case, the &quot;onion&quot; consists
              of 10,000 square feet of carpeting, 40 tons of sheetrock, 4,000
              miles of cable wire and 500 sheets of plywood.</B> </p>
            <p>The carpeting, used in the luxury boxes that housed the network
              news crews, will be sent to Conigliaro Industries in Framingham,
              where it will be ground down and used as filler in concrete. </p>
            <p>&quot;By using the carpeting as a filler it means that less concrete
              has to be generated,&quot; said Daniel Ruben, executive director
              for the Coalition for Environmentally Responsible Conventions. </p>
            <p>Shawmut Design and Construction, the lead construction company
              for the DNC, is donating the plywood to Artists for Humanity, an
              after-school program for children in Boston. The wood will be used
              for easels and painting surfaces, according to founder Susan Rodgerson. </p>
            <p>Most of the sheetrock used during the convention to protect the
              walls of the FleetCenter will be returned to the company that provided
              it, which will use it at a future project, Bauman said. </p>
            <p>When constructing the convention hall, Shawmut chose not to paint
              the sheetrock so that it could be salvaged, said Tom Perry, Shawmut's
              director of engineering services. </p>
            <p>Had it been painted, it would not have been reusable, he said. </p>
            <p><b>CERC will continue to promote &quot;green&quot; construction as
              it plans for the Republican National Convention in New York at
              the end of the month. &quot;We always have to look at both ends
              with construction,&quot; Bauman said. &quot;What comes out of it
              and who can use materials in the end and how we build things in
              a more environmentally friendly way in the beginning.&quot; </B></p>
