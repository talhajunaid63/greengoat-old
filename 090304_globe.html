	    <p>THE BOSTON GLOBE -  September 3, 2004</p>

	<p>A local environmental group that said it helped save 116 tons of construction 
	materials for recycling from the staging of the Democratic National Convention 
	this week turned to encouraging the Republicans to have a ''green" convention in 
	New York. </p>

	<p>The Boston-based Coalition for Environmentally Responsible Conventions said 
	that nearly 88 percent of the wallboard, masonite, carpeting, and fiber optic 
	cables used at the DNC were salvaged or recycled. </p>

	<p>''This is a great opportunity to demonstrate the kinds of practices we believe 
	are needed to address climate change and other pressing environmental issues of 
	our time," said Daniel Ruben, the coalition's executive director. </p>

	<p>The coalition worked with convention planners in Boston and New York to push 
	renewable energy, recycling, and composting. Eventually, the group hopes to spur 
	the hospitality, convention, and tourist industries to adopt environmentally 
	friendly ways of doing business. </p>

	<p><b>Shawmut Design and Construction, the contractor that built and broke down the 
	scaffolding and seats at the FleetCenter, agreed to fasten sheets of plywood with 
	tape or screws instead of nails, so they could be reused, according to Amy Bauman, 
	of greenGoat, an environmental organization in the coalition. </p>

	<p>After the convention, 198 sheets of plywood were divided among local nonprofit 
	groups, including Women in the Building Trades, Jamaica Plain Neighborhood 
	Development Corporation, Artists for Humanity, and Congregation Leon de Juda in 
	Roxbury, Bauman said. </b></p>

	<p>The company that handles construction materials for Madison Square Garden 
	already recycles its materials by using modular units that can be repeatedly 
	reused, said Helena Miele, director of the coalition in New York. </p>

	<p>In relation to the Democratic Convention, the coalition also raised $11,000 
	from donors to purchase renewable energy certificates, which a retail power supplier 
	can spend on energy from a renewable source such as wind or solar rather than one 
	that produces greenhouse gases, said Tod Hynes, the coalition's energy cochairman. </p>

	<p>The coalition estimated that the FleetCenter used about 500 megawatt hours of 
	energy for the DNC. The certificates sold were equivalent to about 800 megawatt 
	hours, or the amount needed to power about 80 average homes for a year, Hynes said. </p>

	<p>Miele said the New York coalition acquired more than $10,000 worth of the 
	certificates in advance for the RNC. </p>

	<p>Recycling of paper, bottles, and cans and composting organic waste was another 
	objective in Boston and New York. </p>

	<p>Waste Management Inc., the company that usually handles trash collection at the 
	FleetCenter, was the contractor for the Democratic Convention. The company is 
	handling the job at the media center in New York, at the Farley Building, Miele 
	said. </p>

	<p>David Tooley, the company's director of government and public affairs, said 
	Waste Management mounted a ''very intensive effort to conduct recycling" at the 
	FleetCenter that was ''well above average" compared with most events his company 
	services and is doing the same in New York. </p>

	<p>Coalition organizers in Boston said the composting was disappointing because 
	containers were contaminated with bottles, cans and other refuse, said John Connolly, 
	a New Hampshire-based consultant overseeing the effort. </p>
