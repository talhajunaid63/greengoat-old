            <p>    Jennifer Weeks, BioCycle </p>    
        
<p>Cleaning up after parties is not an exciting prospect for most people, especially at events like the 2004 Democratic 
National Convention (DNC), which drew 35,000 guests to Boston.  But for greenGoat (www.greengoat.org) -- a Somerville, 
Massachusetts nonprofit that works with developers, contractors, and building material manufacturers to divert 
construction and demolition (C&D) wastes – the convention was a welcome opportunity to demonstrate the benefits of 
deconstruction and recycling. <b>  “Conventions are a perfect showcase for the economics of reuse,” says greenGoat 
founder Amy Bauman, noting that major events like the DNC involve light use and very quick turnover of large quantities 
of materials. </b><p>

Working with the onsite contractor, Shawmut Design and Construction, and the Democratic National Convention Committee 
(DNCC), <b>greenGoat provided advice on designing convention facilities at Boston’s Fleet Center with deconstruction in 
mind, identified end markets for salvaged materials, and helped coordinate demolition activities. </b>The convention stage 
and the media pavilion shell were rented, but Shawmut was responsible for constructing workspace for 15,000 media 
representatives in the media pavilion, the center’s luxury boxes, and a fleet of outdoor trailers.  Tasks included 
shielding the interiors of the luxury boxes to protect them, building platforms for film crews, and installing 90,000 
square feet of nylon carpet, 50 tons of supplemental cooling and 4,000 miles of cable.  <p>

The seeds for greenGoat’s involvement were planted in 2003 when Bauman agreed to co-chair the Coalition for Environmentally 
Responsible Conventions (CERC), an alliance of Boston organizations that was formed to promote eco-friendly policies at 
both 2004 national conventions.  Green construction and recycling were high on CERC’s agenda, and Bauman took the lead in 
advocating for reuse at the Fleet Center when the construction contract was awarded to Shawmut in early 2004.  Like Bauman, 
Shawmut’s project manager Tom Perry, was already LEED accredited, and was receptive to the goals of salvage and recycling.  
The DNCC (the official client) also was supportive, integrating environmental goals at the Fleet Center and other convention 
venues into its media plan.<p>

<b>Shawmut used greenGoat’s bid specification language for inclusion of deconstruction and recycling measures. </b> For 
example, masonite used for floor covering was taped down rather than nailed, and wallboard was left unpainted because a 
local manufacturer agreed to recycle unpainted sheets.  The DNCC requested that reusable materials should go mainly to 
nonprofit organizations working with disadvantaged communities; working with two local reuse centers, Bauman identified 
users for salvaged plywood, masonite, and homosote, including Women in the Building Trades, Artists for Humanity, and 
Jamaica Plain Neighborhood Development Corp.  The project yielded over 100 tons of diverted wastes (88 percent of the total) 
and thousands of dollars in total savings:

<b>Filling an information gap</B><br>
Bauman was a development analyst for Fidelity Investments in Boston when the state of 
Massachusetts proposed banning unprocessed C&D waste from landfills under its Beyond 2000 
Solid Waste Master Plan.  She recognized that the construction industry would need help in 
identifying new disposal options for C&D waste, particularly wood products, and founded 
greenGoat in 2001 to fill that niche.  The company operates as a consulting firm on 
resource management for all phases of land development.  Bauman’s experience with 
cost-benefit analysis undergirds her conviction that deconstruction is sound business 
practice.  “Salvage and recycling help companies take advantage of unseen value in certain 
types of material,” she says, while observing that these practices also deliver 
environmental and community relations benefits.<p>

The company’s central tool is a broad database of markets for C&D materials, developed 
through intensive ongoing research and face-to-face conversations with contractors, 
architects, yards, and certified recyclers and manufacturers.  GreenGoat directs materials 
to local, national, and international users ranging from retail building supply outlets to 
large companies such as Georgia Pacific and DuPont (which recycle gypsum wallboard and 
carpeting, respectively).  Outlets for building materials  develop and reflect such factors 
as commodity price fluctuations, emerging applications for specific materials, and shifting 
transportation and labor costs.  An individual client’s goals, such as the DNCC’s effort to 
direct salvaged convention materials to small nonprofits, may bring new users to light.  
Bauman jokingly calls the company a dating service for material holders and potential users: 
“Some clients want the money from scrap value, and others just want to find placement in 
strategic markets.  It basically comes down to customer service.”<p>

In some instances, greenGoat may be able to make a match by overcoming obstacles to a 
specific use.  For example, Maine permits recycling of used asphalt roof shingles for road 
construction, but Massachusetts bars the practice out of concern that the road asphalt will 
be contaminated with asbestos.  Under a grant from the Home Depot Foundation, greenGoat is 
analyzing ways to ensure that asphalt shingles are free from contamination as they go into 
the grinding process, thus allowing more shingles to be recycled and reducing disposal costs.  <p>

Collaborating with local regulatory agencies helps keep greenGoat abreast of developments that 
may impact markets for C&D materials.  Bauman serves on a subcommittee convened by the Massachusetts 
Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) that worked from 2002-2004 to recommend the language 
of the proposed C&D waste ban, and greenGoat received a DEP grant in 2002 to develop a series of 
case studies identifying potential markets for C&D materials and quantifying disposal cost savings 
from deconstruction.  In addition to calculating cost savings and tons of materials diverted, these 
studies highlighted the roles of advance planning and appropriate equipment in successful 
deconstruction projects.<p>  

In one case, during redevelopment of the Eagle Square shopping center in Providence, Rhode Island, 
contractor Costello Dismantling used a Komatsu long arm to extract valuable old-growth yellow pine 
timbers from 1911-vintage factory building frames for resale.  Renovation of a historic fire station 
in Milford, Massachusetts in 2002 was facilitated when Consigli Construction rented a QuikreteTM 
concrete silo on wheels which could be moved around the construction site and was filled with pre-mix, 
saving time, money, and packaging.  In addition, by coordinating with neighbors to shift dumpsters 
around the tight workspace during demolition, the company obtained access to valuable space and extra 
containers for source separation.<p>

This kind of efficiency and collaboration help to guarantee that deconstruction will yield clean and 
consistent products for reuse.  Accordingly, greenGoat advises clients on project planning, trains 
crews and subcontractors on material recovery, coordinates onsite logistics such as dumpster placement 
and pickup schedules, and maintains close communication between project managers, work crews, and end 
markets.  Bauman emphasizes the importance of spelling out salvage and recycling requirements up front 
to ensure that materials are handled properly: “People do what they’re paid to do, so get it in the spec.  
The biggest money saver in the long run is the first round of decisions.”  For example, at the Democratic 
convention, the gypsum recycler could only accept one load daily, so some gypsum dumpsters were shifted 
to other materials.  Demolition had to be completed within 10 days after the convention ended, so work 
proceeded around the clock, and distribution of salvaged materials to nonprofit recipients was scheduled 
after all demolition materials had been removed.<p>  

<b>Green Pastures</b><br>
	Massachusetts is currently reviewing public comments on revised wording of its proposed C&D waste 
ban, and the DEP expects to promulgate the final regulations as soon as late 2004, although the department 
may add a transition period before the ban takes effect.  While some players in the construction industry 
are already anticipating the ban, the need for new markets -- especially for wood -- will only increase as 
the measure moves toward enactment.  A 2003 study for the DEP by the Boston-based Tellus Institute estimated 
that if the ban were implemented, C&D recycling in Massachusetts would increase from about 3.5 million tons 
in 2000 to more than 5 million tons in 2010.  (This figure assumed that the ban would enter into force by the 
end of 2003, so the actual figure will likely be somewhat lower).  The study recommended developing targeted 
education and training programs for C&D contractors and processing and disposal facilities, modeled after 
similar programs in North Carolina, Washington state, and Vancouver.  <p>

Massachusetts DEP maintains a number of online resources on recycling C&D debris, including a directory of 
service providers, greenGoat case studies, and specifications and calculators adapted from the King County, 
Washington construction recycling program (http://www.mass.gov/dep/recycle/cdhome.htm).  The department plans 
to develop more case studies on markets for C&D materials, based on the work done by greenGoat.  The approach 
greenGoat used for the DEP project was “very useful.  It really helped us develop a template,” says Jim McQuade, 
Regional Planner with the department’s Bureau of Waste Prevention.  <p>

The issue is equally pressing in other New England states.  Throughout the region, tipping fees are high 
(averaging $80-100 per ton in the Boston area), landfill space is in short supply, and states are working to 
reduce greenhouse gas emissions from all major sectors, including waste.  High oil prices increase the 
transportation cost of moving raw materials, offering manufacturers an incentive to consider recycling where 
possible (greenGoat lowered C&D disposal costs during the DNC to $31.37 per ton on average).  In sum, a strong 
market exists for greenGoat’s services.<p>
In Bauman’s view, more contractors will adopt deconstruction methodologies as quickly as greenGoat can develop or 
help develop applications for C&D materials. “We are limited only by our imaginations.  Once people see how much 
money they can save, and how much sense it makes to recognize the value of the resources we sometimes call ‘waste’; 
they are happy to have someone come in and offer a new way to do things – one that respects their bottom line and 
doesn’t paint conservation as serving only the environment.  It’s a good time to be here.”<p>
