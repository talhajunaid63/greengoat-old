            <p>01:00 AM EDT on Wednesday, December 1, 2004 </p>
            <p><strong>BY LOIS LEVIN </strong><strong><br> Newton Tab </strong></p>
            <p>A 50s-style rance is not forever; it is often assumed that it is cost-effective to demolish such homes and 
	rebuild, rather than to removel in order to accommodate a growing family.  But a "tear-down" typically generates 
	mountains of materials, which are placed in a dumpster and hauled to a landfill - at great expense (the average
	"tipping fee" in this area is now $85/ton), and at increasingly greater distances from the source, as more and more
	landfills have been closed permanently.</P>
	<P>An envorinmentalist/entrepreneur from Somerville, Amy Bauman, knows that there is a better and cost-saving way to
	do a teardown.  Since 2001, her non-profit organization, greenGoat, has been "de-installing" a wide variety of 
	building materials and recycling them, mainly by donating them to other non-profit groups.</P>
	<P>Until now, greenGoat has focused on large-scale or commercial properties, but last month it assisted a savvy 
	homeowner from Newton's south side to recycle her ranch-style house in order to build a green home on the same 
	footprint.  This is not about creating a "mcmansion"; on the contrary,the new house will be no larger.  It may in 
	fact be smaller, than the original.  But the homeowner will pickup a sizable tax redit for having donated a wide 
	variety of reusable building items such as metals. Some materials, specifically flagstones and electrical fixtures, 
	wil be reused on site.  But wood flooring, cabinets, roofing material, wallboard, carpeting, windows, doors and many 
	other items were quickly disassembled and removed prior to the final demolitiona nd carted off for reuse or recycling.
	</p>
	<P>The basic idea that underlies this work, to design buildings or anything else, with a "cradle to cradle" (rather
	than a "cradle to grave") approach, is a concept elaborated in the 2002 book "Cradle to Cradle" by University
	of Virginia architect William McDonough and Michael Braungart, a German chemist.  Their work on sustainable design 
	has beeN inspirational to people in many diverse fields who are deeply concerned about the Environment.</P>
	<P>Bauman, with a grackground in finance, high tech and product development, is no stranger to cost/benefit analysis. 
	She is committed to reducing construction waste by promoting "design for deconstruction."  She also sees enormous
	opportunity for win-win situations in the business end of deconstructing buildings.  greenGoat's workers are often
	young people learning trades, and they are typically paid $35/hour to disassemble a building.</P>
	<P>this past August, greenGoat, working with CERC, headquartered in Newton, and with the Fleet Center contractor 
	(Shawmut Design and Contruction), orchestrated, choreographed, the deconstruction of the interior structures created
	for the Democratic National Convention.  That operation involved donating large amounts of plywood, masonite, 
	wallboard (50 tons!), carpet, and miles of communications cable to local non-profit recycling organizations, mainly
	ReStore and Boston Materials Resource Center.</P>
	<P>So whether you are undertaking a renovation project at home or plan to demolish an entire commercial building,
	recyclng building amterials is the way to go.  You will be "earthwise" and keep tons of material, including toxic
	substances, out of the waste stream.  You will save money by selling to conventional salvagers, and you will be
	entitled to a big fat tax break by funneling those materials to non-profit organizations.</p>
